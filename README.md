# AIRBNB-ANALYSIS-GUVI-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
Problem Statement:

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas. It includes data cleaning, preparation, interactive geospatial visualizations, and dynamic plots to uncover insights related to pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends. The specific objectives are to:

    Establish MongoDB Connection and Retrieve Data: Connect to MongoDB Atlas, access the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.
    Data Cleaning and Preparation: Address missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
    Interactive Geospatial Visualization: Develop a Streamlit web application to create interactive maps that showcase the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore factors such as prices and ratings.
    Price Analysis and Visualization: Analyze and visualize price variations by location, property type, and season using dynamic plots and charts.
    Availability Patterns: Examine seasonal availability and visualize occupancy rates and demand fluctuations using appropriate visualizations.
    Location-Based Insights: Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods to gain insights into location-based trends.
    Interactive Visualizations: Create interactive visualizations that let users filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences.
    Comprehensive Dashboard Creation: Use Tableau or Power BI to build a dashboard that integrates various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.

Approach:

    MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:
        Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster.
        Load the Airbnb sample data into your cluster.
        Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas and retrieve the dataset for analysis.

    Data Cleaning and Preparation:
        Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types as necessary.
        Prepare the dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

    Geospatial Visualization:
        Develop a Streamlit web application to create interactive maps using the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset.
        Allow users to explore listing distribution, prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

    Price Analysis and Visualization:
        Analyze price variations by location, property type, and season.
        Create dynamic plots and charts to visualize price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.

    Availability Analysis by Season:
        Analyze how availability varies with seasons.
        Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations using line charts, heatmaps, or other suitable visualizations.

    Location-Based Insights:
        Investigate price variations across different locations or neighborhoods.
        Use MongoDB queries and data aggregation techniques to extract and visualize relevant information.

    Interactive Visualizations:
        Develop dynamic visualizations that allow users to filter and explore data based on specific criteria.
        Enable interaction with the visualizations to delve into particular regions, property types, or time periods.

    Dashboard Creation:
        Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI.
        Integrate various visualizations, including maps, charts, and tables, to present a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and insights.

MongoDB Atlas Setup:

    Create a MongoDB Atlas Account:
        Sign up at the MongoDB Atlas website and follow the registration process to set up your account and create a new project.

    Set Up a Cluster:
        Within your MongoDB Atlas project, configure and create a cluster. Choose the cloud provider and region, set cluster specifications, and complete the setup.

    Load the Airbnb Sample Data:
        Access the MongoDB Atlas dashboard and create a database user with necessary permissions.
        Set up IP whitelisting or other security measures.
        Import the Airbnb sample data by selecting the “Load Sample Dataset” option in the cluster’s “Collections” tab.
